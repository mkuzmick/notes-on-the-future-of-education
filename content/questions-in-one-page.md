# Puzzles and Questions: A Short Version

Open questions for rethinking higher education in the age of AI.

---

AI is heading toward "intelligence too cheap to meter." Routine cognitive work — summarizing, drafting, analyzing, coding — is becoming radically cheap. The question for education is stark: *what is the human for?*

We see a pattern we might call **scarcity migration**: first we lacked texts, then access to texts, then the ability to select among texts — now, increasingly, the scarcity is *caring about texts at all*. Each generation solves the previous bottleneck, only to discover the constraint has moved upstream.

What follows are questions — not answers — organized around five shifts.

## The work is changing

Consider what a senior faculty member actually does: they design studies, evaluate arguments, decide what questions are worth asking, and judge whether results hold up. They produce less and judge more. AI is accelerating this pattern everywhere. We are shifting from **authoring** to **authorizing** — from originating work to taking responsibility for outputs we didn't produce from scratch. The failure mode shifts with it: from "I didn't finish" to "I didn't notice."

- Can you train someone to authorize work they've never authored themselves?
- If competence is now a commodity, where does value migrate? How do we cultivate genuine excellence?
- What happens to intellectual ownership when the raw material is machine-generated?

## The university's role is under pressure

The university held a near-monopoly on texts, training, and certification. AI breaks that arrangement. And the authoring-to-authorizing shift is happening to the institution itself — it's becoming less the place where knowledge is made and more the institution that vouches for how it was made, and for the people who made it.

- What is the university for, now that it's no longer where the books are?
- Is the university also shifting from authoring to authorizing? Can it be a credible authorizer?
- Should it become an "epistemic notary" — certifying process rather than judging value?
- What does a degree certify if AI can do much of the work the degree once guaranteed?

## What students need to learn is different

The traditional disciplinary apprenticeship may no longer fit. Students need judgment, taste, care, and attention — but also the ability to design whole systems of inquiry, not just execute within them. And they need a new metacognitive skill: knowing whether they actually *know* something or merely *have access* to it.

- How do experts develop without doing junior work? AI is most useful to people who already have expertise — but the path to expertise is what AI lets you bypass.
- Should we be teaching taste? The humanities moved away from it, but we are now drowning in slop. If no one can distinguish the excellent from the adequate, the slop wins by volume.
- How do we address *false fluency* — the illusion of mastery when AI handles the scaffolding? Do students *care* whether they actually know? The false fluency problem isn't just cognitive — it's a crisis of caring.

## Some things should not change

Some things the university does become *more* valuable precisely because they resist automation. The question is which slownesses are worth protecting.

- How do we transmit intellectual desire — the kind that can only be caught from people who already care?
- Can college teach students to break paradigms, not just learn them? Or is college's job to build the foundation deep enough that it can eventually be broken?
- How do we protect identity formation when AI can be a constant interlocutor and mirror?
- When should students think without AI? The skill is knowing when to protect a space from AI entirely.
- Is boredom a prerequisite for original thought?

## Teaching and assessment need to catch up

Even well-designed assignments are vulnerable to the tools they're meant to govern. AI can generate plausible validation logs and documentation of struggle that never happened. At some point, the student has to be *present*.

- Should we bring back the oral defense — not to prove you did the work, but to prove you can *account* for it?
- Can we now expect dramatically more from students? The ceiling rises: "build something that makes X legible to others" replaces "write about X."
- How do we leverage AI for feedback at scale — diagnostic tools as sophisticated as what exists for baseball swings — while keeping faculty in the loop?
- Is ethics now inseparable from competence? If work is subtly flawed, it isn't a separate problem — it's simply *broken*.

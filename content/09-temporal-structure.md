# Temporal Structure

The university as a place of "productive friction" is intriguing but risks sounding like a defense of inefficiency for its own sake—"we're valuable because we're slow and annoying."

That's not quite right.

What the university actually offers is a different relationship to time.

It is one of the few institutions that can ask people to spend sustained time with difficulty without immediate payoff.

That's not friction. That's temporal structure.

Friction is what you want to eliminate.

Temporal structure is what you want to protect.

The difference:
- Friction: bureaucratic delay, unnecessary obstacles, pointless repetition
- Temporal structure: the requirement that some things take time because the *taking of time* is part of what produces the result

Some learning requires duration:
- The slow absorption of a discipline's ways of seeing
- The gradual development of taste through repeated encounter
- The formation of intellectual character through years of practice
- The maturation of ideas that only happens with distance

AI makes many things faster. It cannot compress everything.

The university's value proposition includes: "We will protect a space where some things are allowed to be slow."

This is a luxury in an accelerating world. It may become the central luxury.

The question for curriculum: which slownesses are essential, and which are merely traditional?

Not everything that takes time deserves to. But some things that take time *must* take time—and the university should be able to articulate which, and why.

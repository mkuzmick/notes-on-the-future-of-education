# Forward Sentries

The future of "code" — and what comes after it.

## The Typing Pool

Not long ago — within the professional memory of anyone now working at a university — Harvard faculty did not type. They wrote, of course, but the mechanical act of pressing keys was someone else's problem. Departments employed typists, and the arrangement seemed not only natural but vaguely dignified, a division of labor befitting the life of the mind. To suggest that a tenured professor of history might benefit from learning to operate a word processor would have been received as one receives a category error: not offensive, exactly, but faintly absurd. And then, without anyone quite authorizing it, the absurdity reversed polarity. Now it is the notion of routing your paragraphs through a human intermediary that seems quaint — an inefficiency dressed up as hierarchy.

## The Pattern

This pattern recurs with the regularity of a tide. Every few decades, a capacity that was once specialized, professionalized, cordoned off behind equipment and expertise, becomes ordinary. Not dumbed down — democratized. The tools become cheap, then ubiquitous, then invisible, and the skill migrates from a guild into a grammar. Photography did this. Filmmaking did this. From roughly 2006 to 2016, the smartphone accomplished in a single device what an entire century of media technology had been building toward: it made every person a photographer, a cinematographer, an editor, a distributor. Today each undergraduate is producing, across Instagram stories and TikTok and whatever comes next, a body of documentary work that would dwarf the lifetime output of most pre-digital filmmakers — and they are doing it without once thinking of themselves as filmmakers. The skill didn't disappear. It dissolved into the culture.

## The Cardiologist

Now consider what a cardiologist named Michał Nedoszytko accomplished recently. Working alone — in the hospital, on planes, across seven sleepless days — he built an application sophisticated enough to place third in a hackathon that drew thirteen thousand entries. He is not a software engineer. He is a doctor who happened to have a domain problem and, for the first time in the history of computing, access to tools that let him address it directly. The typing pool didn't just shrink. It ceased to be necessary.

## Beyond "Code"

This is the early, still-awkward phase of something enormous. Code — that word we use as if it names a single thing — is about to undergo the same vertiginous democratization that happened to typing, to photography, to film. But to call it "code" is already to understate the case, because what is actually being democratized is not any particular programming language but the entire practice of building systems that do things in the world. The layers of abstraction piled atop raw binary have been climbing for decades: machine language gave way to C, C to Python, Python to frameworks, frameworks to no-code platforms. Each layer brought the act of making software closer to the act of thinking about what you want software to do. We are approaching the point where the distance between those two things collapses entirely.

## X

What emerges on the other side will not be "code" in any sense a software engineer would recognize. Call it *X*, for lack of a better term — the unnamed discipline that subsumes logical systems and data models, interaction patterns and branching narratives, image grammars and agent architectures, the whole apparatus of structured intention. *X* is what you do when you have a goal — industrial, academic, emotional, artistic — and the ability to specify the systems required to achieve it. It is, in some sense, what coding always wanted to be before it got bogged down in syntax.

And it will seem, in retrospect, as peculiar that this capacity was once restricted to people who had learned Python or Rust as it now seems that writing was once restricted to people who had learned to operate a typewriter. Even the current moment — in which tools like Claude Code are genuinely remarkable but still require a certain technical fluency to wield — will come to look like a transitional phase, a brief era in which the democratization was real but not yet total. The cardiologist built his app, but he still had to stay up all night to do it.

## The Loss of the Guild

The honest discomfort in all of this belongs to the people who currently possess the specialized skill. (There is always, in these transitions, a moment of loss for the guild.) The programmer who spent years learning to think in abstractions will find that the abstraction layer has moved above them, and with it the locus of value. The differentiating human skill, going forward, will not be the ability to write code. It will be the ability to keep up — to continuously identify what you are trying to do, to perceive the interaction patterns that could do it better, to build the systems and then move on to the next problem, and the next, and the next. It is a skill less like engineering than like navigation: reading the current, adjusting the heading, never mistaking the position you hold now for the position you will hold tomorrow.

## The Urgency

This has implications for education that are, to put it mildly, urgent. If the world students are entering is one in which the capacity to build systems is universal, then the question of what we are teaching them — and what we are teaching them *for* — requires answers we do not yet have. We need people thinking about this now, not in the careful, peer-reviewed, five-year-horizon way that universities are comfortable with, but in the reckless, experimental, up-all-night way that the situation demands. We need an avant-garde: forward sentries who will go out into the territory ahead and report back on what they find, not because they have a map but because no map yet exists.

## Stepping Outside

The phrase is Marinetti's, from the Futurist Manifesto of 1909 — a document whose specific prescriptions are largely horrifying but whose opening scene remains one of the great evocations of what it feels like to be awake at the precise moment the world changes. "An immense pride was buoying us up," he wrote, "because we felt ourselves alone at that hour, alone, awake, and on our feet, like proud beacons or forward sentries against an army of hostile stars glaring down at us from their celestial encampments." The pride is not in having the answers. It is in being conscious — stubbornly, almost physically conscious — of the fact that the answers are needed, that the hour is late, and that someone has to be the first to step outside.

We could use a few more people willing to step outside.

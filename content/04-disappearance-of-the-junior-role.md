# The Disappearance of the Junior Role

One of the most profound curricular implications is rarely discussed: AI doesn't just change what experts do; it collapses the apprenticeship ladder.

The traditional model was that students did junior versions of expert work—write a paper, run an analysis, draft a brief—and thereby learned to do senior versions. Expertise developed through doing.

If AI does the junior work, the whole gradient disappears.

How do you become a senior surgeon if you never did junior surgeries?

This is the real pedagogical crisis, and it's not about "judgment" in the abstract. It's about how expertise actually develops through doing.

You can't train supervisors who never did the work being supervised. You can't develop taste without making bad art first. You can't cultivate judgment without making and learning from mistakes.

The question isn't whether AI can do the junior work competently. It can.

The question is what replaces "learning by doing bad versions first" as a mechanism for developing expertise.

Possible answers:
- Simulation with explicit feedback loops
- Adversarial review of AI work (finding the seams)
- Accelerated apprenticeship where the "junior" phase is compressed but not eliminated
- New forms of embodied or material practice that resist automation

None of these are fully worked out. This is the open problem.

The university must reckon with the fact that it has always been a place for doing junior versions of expert work.

If that function disappears, what remains?

Possibly: the formation of people who know *why* the expert work matters at all.

# Ground Truth and Provenance

As AI-generated simulations and papers flood the zone, the gold standard for research will shift toward things AI can't hallucinate: raw field data, physical lab results, primary archival discovery.

Disciplines will increasingly be defined by their "ground truth" protocols.

If a student can't prove where the data touched the real world, the system design doesn't matter.

This is not a return to naive empiricism. It's a credibility defense.

When symbolic space is cheap to fill, the physical and the empirical become scarce again:
- Archival provenance
- Physical measurement
- Embodied encounter
- Primary data with verifiable origin

**Provenance vs. Canon**

Canon-making asks: *what matters?*

Provenance asks: *how did it come to matter?*

The university as guarantor of epistemic conditions—notary, auditor, witness—is different from the university as arbiter of value.

It's less authoritarian, more defensible, more compatible with AI-assisted critique of authority.

One of the university's functions might be certification of origin—not just "this text is good" but "this text was produced under conditions we can verify."

The degree becomes a kind of epistemic notarization: this person worked through a process we can account for.

This shifts assessment from product to process:
- Not "is this essay good?" but "can you show me how it was made?"
- Not "did you get the right answer?" but "can you trace the reasoning?"
- Not "what do you know?" but "how do you know it?"

The verifiable audit trail becomes as important as the final output.

# Curation and Taste

"Critique" can feel negative. It implies finding fault, tearing down, skepticism as default.

"Taste" is different. It implies formation, cultivation, developing a point of view.

In an age of infinite average outputs, the student's job is to move the needle from competent to exceptional.

Learning becomes an apprenticeship in aesthetics and ethics.

We aren't just teaching them to find errors; we're teaching them to have a point of view.

Faculty understand taste. Studios understand taste. Hiring committees understand taste.

"Critique" closes doors. "Taste" opens them.

Taste is:
- Knowing what good looks like in a specific domain
- Having preferences you can defend
- Recognizing quality before you can articulate why
- Developing that recognition into articulable judgment

The shift from "critique" to "curation" changes the pedagogical posture:

Instead of: "What's wrong with this?"

Try: "What would make this exceptional? What's missing? What would you change if you could only change one thing?"

Instead of: "Is this accurate?"

Try: "Is this *good*? Would you want to read more of this? Would you hire the person who made this?"

AI produces the competent middle. Human value lies in distinguishing the competent middle from the genuinely good—and in pushing toward the genuinely good.

That's taste. And it's teachable, but only through extensive encounter with examples, guided discussion, and practice making judgments that others will evaluate.

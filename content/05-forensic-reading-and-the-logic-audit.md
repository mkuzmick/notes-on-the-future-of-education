# Forensic Reading and the Logic Audit

If the "paper" is no longer proof of thinking, the only way to establish intellectual responsibility is to put the human in the hot seat.

**Forensic Reading**

Students must learn to look at AI output with a "hermeneutics of suspicion"—hunting for the seams where the logic breaks.

This is not generic skepticism. It's a trained eye for specific failure modes:
- Hallucinated citations
- Plausible but unsupported causal claims
- Pattern-matching that looks like reasoning
- Confident prose covering uncertain ground

Instead of telling students "Don't trust AI," we tell them: "Prove *why* this AI is wrong." This transforms the student from passive consumer into detective of logic.

**The Logic Audit**

A student presents a project. The professor (or a peer "prosecutor") asks:

"The AI chose this specific methodology. Why did you sign off on it? What were the three discarded alternatives, and why was this one the least risky?"

If the student says "Because the AI suggested it," they fail.

They must be able to defend the machine's logic as if it were their own.

**The Validation Log**

Assignments are no longer just about the final product. Students submit a validation log alongside their work:
- What did the AI produce?
- What did you verify?
- What did you change, and why?
- What risks remain?

If the AI hallucinates a legal precedent and the student doesn't catch it, they don't just lose points—they've demonstrated they aren't yet qualified to authorize.

**The Vibe Shift**

Instead of a student at a podium with a PowerPoint, they sit at a table with a panel. They aren't presenting their results; they're defending their audit trail.

The key question: "On page 4, the system made a jump from Data A to Conclusion B. You signed off on that. Walk us through the three logical tests you ran to verify that the system didn't hallucinate the correlation."

This is the return of the oral defense—but for a new reason.

It's not about proving you did the work (the work is cheap now). It's about proving you can *account* for the work.

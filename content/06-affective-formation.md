# Affective Formation

Most AI discourse is cognitive: systems, judgment, authority, logic.

But one of the things the university actually does is socialize people into *caring* about certain questions.

You don't just learn what historians know; you learn to *want* to know what historians know.

AI can produce competent text about the French Revolution. It can't make someone fall in love with the archive.

That affective transmission—what used to be called "formation"—might be the thing that's hardest to replicate and therefore most valuable.

Universities don't just teach methods. They teach people to care.

AI can simulate interest. It can't transmit desire.

That's a real scarcity.

In an age of infinite competent output, the scarcest resource is genuine intellectual desire.

The institution that can cultivate it will matter more, not less.

The university's core function becomes neither custodial nor decisional but *formational*: not just determining which texts matter, but cultivating the capacity to care about the question at all.

Its power lies in its ability to slow people down, to socialize them into sustained engagement with difficulty, to make them *want* to know rather than just know.

This is distinct from "student engagement" as typically measured.

It's not about interest or enjoyment. It's about the formation of desire that outlasts the course, that makes someone return to a question years later because they can't let it go.

That kind of formation happens through encounter with people who already care—and through institutions that protect the space for that encounter.

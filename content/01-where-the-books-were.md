# Where the Books Were

For most of its history, the university's authority was grounded in material scarcity. Harvard's library wasn't a symbol of knowledge; it *was* knowledge, in the only form that mattered: singular, physical, locatable. To study was to go where the books were.

When Google scanned those libraries, the monopoly cracked but didn't shatter. Harvard still held the originals, and originals still carried aura. The university remained custodial: keeper of the texts, trainer of the readers, grantor of the credentials that certified both. This was reproduction without displacement—everyone got a copy, but the original retained its power.

AI breaks this arrangement more completely than digitization ever did. We've moved from a world of copies to a world of generation—infinite texts, competent and fluent, unanchored to any author or archive. Possession of "the" text is irrelevant when text is a utility, like water or electricity.

The scarcity has migrated from the production of the word to the sustained attention of the reader. We are drowning in the competent. The old boundaries of the syllabus are being washed away by synthetic prose that looks and sounds exactly like authority.

The university's mission must pivot from custody to canon-making. Its value no longer lies in where the books are, but in the social contract of legitimacy. The university is the institution that decides which texts are worth our finite human hours—which arguments are rigorous, which data is clean, which ideas deserve to be woven into the cultural fabric.

It is no longer a warehouse for knowledge; it is a high-stakes filter.

But here's the complication: canon-making is rhetorically strong but structurally fragile.

It assumes legitimacy is granted rather than contested. It underplays how AI empowers counter-canons, remixing, and critique of the very institutions claiming authority. The university isn't just competing with abundant content; it's competing with abundant *critique* of its own authority.

The question isn't just "who decides what counts?" but "why should anyone accept that this institution's decisions count?"

This is why selection alone cannot carry the university's future. What actually survives is something deeper: formation.

# Research as System Design

Most disciplines have trained undergraduates to approximate expert behavior by reproducing its outputs: papers, proofs, analyses.

AI collapses that ladder.

Instead, disciplines increasingly become about:
- Designing conceptual frames
- Building interpretive scaffolds
- Curating corpora, methods, and constraints
- Evaluating *why* a system produces a result, not just *what* it produces

This subtly repositions faculty expertise:

Less: "I know more facts than you"

More: "I know how to stage inquiry in this field"

Faculty research already reflects this shift:
- Humanities scholars assembling archives + methods + interpretive lenses
- Scientists coordinating simulations, models, pipelines, and collaborators
- Social scientists managing datasets, models, and theory together

AI makes this visible—and teachable.

Curricular implication: Undergraduates should encounter research as system design earlier.

- How arguments are *constructed*, not just written
- How models are *shaped*, not just run
- How evidence is framed, filtered, and stressed

Presentation shifts from paper to performance:

If AI can generate competent prose on demand, the paper stops being the privileged endpoint.

Expect:
- More performative scholarship (demos, walkthroughs, annotated systems)
- Greater emphasis on process artifacts (prompts, datasets, decision logs)
- Increased legitimacy of multimodal academic communication

Scholarship becomes something that can be *experienced*, not just read.

The expert is no longer defined by superior execution.

The expert is defined by knowing which questions to ask, which methods to apply, which constraints to impose, and which results to trust.

Undergraduates should start learning to think like that much earlier.

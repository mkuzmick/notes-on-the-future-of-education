# Possession → Selection → Formation

The university's value migrates in three stages:

**Possession**: The library was the crown jewel. Knowledge lived in specific places. Authority was geographic.

**Selection**: When texts became abundant, value shifted to deciding which texts matter. The university as canon-maker, epistemic filter, arbiter of what counts.

**Formation**: But selection is unstable without legitimacy. Legitimacy comes from transparent process. And process alone isn't enough—you need people who *care* about the question at all.

The surface layer works for faculty provocation:
- Warehouse → Canon
- Custody → Decision
- Production → Judgment

The structural layer is defensive and institutional:
- Canon is unstable without legitimacy
- Legitimacy comes from transparent process
- Hence: provenance, protocols, temporal structure

The deep layer is what actually survives:
- Formation of taste
- Formation of desire
- Formation of responsibility
- Formation of judgment under uncertainty

The university cannot merely decide what counts.

It must cultivate people who can *justify why something should count*, care enough to do so, and take responsibility for the consequences.

That's a much harder sell—but also a much truer one.

# The Weight of the Signature

In the past, a degree certified that you could *do* the work.

In the future, a degree certifies that you are qualified to *authorize* the work.

This shift from executor to authorizer changes the entire feel of education—from study hall to high-stakes simulation.

If an AI writes a legal brief or a medical diagnosis, the human isn't just "editing" it; they are legally and ethically responsible for it. The "human-in-the-loop" framing is bloodless. "You're the one who signs your name" is not.

The future job is liability and logic.

We need to train students for the *weight* of that responsibility, not just the workflow of it.

This is already what managers and editors and lawyers do all day: defend decisions they didn't technically originate.

The difference is that students used to learn by doing junior versions of expert work—write a paper, run an analysis, draft a brief—and thereby learned to do senior versions.

Now the junior work is automated. The gradient disappears. We're asking people to authorize before they've executed.

So we have to teach authorization directly: epistemic agency, the ability to own a thought you didn't technically originate.

The professional shift:

| Old "Knowledge Work" | New "Liability & Logic" |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| Primary task: Production of content | Primary task: Verification of intent |
| Core virtue: Accuracy & diligence | Core virtue: Judgment & skepticism |
| Value-add: How fast can you do it? | Value-add: How much risk can you mitigate? |
| Failure mode: "I didn't finish." | Failure mode: "I didn't notice." |

A provocative thought: We should stop teaching Ethics as a standalone, 101-level course.

In this new world, ethics is the same thing as quality control. If a student's work is unethical or logically flawed, it is simply *broken*.

We are training cognitive risk managers.

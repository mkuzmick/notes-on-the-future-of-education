Core formulations emerging across the material.

## The Migration of University Value

**Possession → Selection → Formation**

The university was where the books were. Then it became where decisions were made about what counts. But selection is unstable without legitimacy, and legitimacy requires something deeper: the formation of people who care about the question at all.

## The Fourfold Shift

| Domain | From | To |
|--------|------|-----|
| Curriculum | Outputs | Systems |
| Learning | Production | Judgment |
| Work | Doing | Deciding |
| University | Knowledge holder | Epistemic trainer |

## The Executor-Authorizer Transition

In the past, a degree certified you could *do* the work.

In the future, a degree certifies you can *authorize* the work.

## Scarcity Migration

- Old scarcity: producing texts
- Intermediate scarcity: accessing texts
- Current scarcity: selecting among texts
- Emerging scarcity: caring about texts at all

## The Central Aphorism

> Undergraduate education after AI is less about teaching students to think like experts—and more about teaching them to design, interrogate, and govern thinking systems, including their own.

## The Hardest Thing to Replicate

AI can simulate interest. It can't transmit desire.

Universities teach people to care. That's the scarcest resource.

## The Open Problem

If AI does the junior work, how do students become experts?

The apprenticeship ladder has collapsed. What replaces "learning by doing bad versions first"?

## The University's Remaining Power

The ability to:
- Slow people down
- Require duration without immediate payoff
- Socialize people into sustained engagement with difficulty
- Make them *want* to know rather than just know

## The Three Layers

**Surface** (for faculty provocation):
- Warehouse → Canon
- Custody → Decision
- Production → Judgment

**Structural** (for institutional defense):
- Canon requires legitimacy
- Legitimacy requires transparent process
- Hence: provenance, protocols, temporal structure

**Deep** (what actually survives):
- Formation of taste
- Formation of desire
- Formation of responsibility
- Formation of judgment under uncertainty
